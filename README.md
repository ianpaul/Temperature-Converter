# Temperature-Converter
A Fahrenheit to Celsius/Celsius to Fahrenheit converter for CLIs written in Rust

This is a practice script as I'm learning how to use Rust. It's a simple app that asks if you want to convert from Fahrenheit or Celsius.
Then it asks for the actual temperature, and then it outputs the result with a descriptive emoji.
