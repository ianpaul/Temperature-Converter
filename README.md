# Temperature-Converter
A Fahrenheit to Celsius/Celsius to Fahrenheit converter for CLIs written in Rust

This is a practice script I put together as part of my learning journey with Rust. It's a simple CLI app that asks if you want to convert from Fahrenheit or Celsius.

Then it asks for the actual temperature, which it outputs as the converted temperature with a descriptive emoji next to it.
